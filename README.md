# Eleetecode-x

## How it works:

A repository dedicated to fairly complete and detailed solutions for common CS coding challenge questions. Each question will have the following:
- **The question** _<question_name>/<question_name.md>_: This should be as straight forward and concise as possible. It can include diagrams or other visualizations to aid communicating the problem but idealy the written description and some sample input/output should be enough to understand the general problems.

- **The solutions** _<question_name>/solutions/<question_name__#>_: There can be multiple of these depending on how many languages have been submitted. A good solution is functioning, describes how it works, and provides a **runtime**.

- **Additional Resources** _<question_name>/<question_name_hints.md>_: Often looking at the solution can make it nearly impossible to come up with one yourself. If you get stuck this section exists with a set of resources or text based hints to guide you along the right track.


## Contributing 
Contributions are encouraged! If you would like to add a solution to an existing problem in a new language or with an existing language with a runtime improvement please just submit a PR and it will be merged once it has been validated.

If you want to add a new problem simply align with the above layout and it will be merged assuming this problem is properly described, is in the spirit of the repository, and it has a valid solution.
